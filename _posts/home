COPS is a small kyacking club that is located in the lee valley.

We specialize in Sprint and Marathon racing but are willing to compete in all other forms of kyacking including white water racing and slalmon.

We have existed for many years as part of HYMB at Chesthunt and our boats are presently based at ESSA in Nazing.  We are members of the Flatwater Racing Association and
compete with local teams including those from Bishops Stortford, Chelmsford, Leeside and Barking.  

We are presently trying to get back on our feet after moving and the lockdown.  We aim to start training on the Canal in the Autumn with small groups 
meeting once or twice a week and being assigned boats, paddles and other kit which will either be taken home or taken out of storage when as needed.
