Family Orientated.  Flatwater paddling is suitable for people of all ages.  The young people enjoy the cut and thrust of racing while the sport provides a low impact workout for the older paddlers who enjoy the surroundings 
for the older ones of us and all enjoy the social aspects of paddling and being in the open air.  Parents can also provide bankside support and encouragement and oppertunities to build coachinbg skills

Ability to go on.  Kyack Racing and Canoe slalom are Olympic sports with relativly low take up.  It is not unknown for our paddlers to progress to National or International competitions    

A year round sport.  You can paddle most of the year.  The lakes, rivers and canals are particularly beautiful in autumn and winter and we have typically concentrated on racing during this period.

Mix and match disciplines.  Paddling offers a variety of experiences.   Those of us who crave excitement can concentrate on slalom or white water racing and although 
we do not focus on these disciplins we have equipment and have provided tasters into these disciplines.  Racing requires an efficient paddle stroke which, once attained is a transferrable skill
